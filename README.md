## 🧑‍💼 About Me
Hi! I'm Jake Welsh, a recent graduate in ***Computer Science*** from ***Northern Illinois University***. I originally started college as a nursing student, but I quickly realized that my true passion was in tech. After making the switch, I never looked back. Now I'm focused on building software, solving problems, and continuing to grow as a developer. I have experience in C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, COBOL, and IBM Assembly Language.

## 🚧 Current Projects
- **Resume Parser + Job Tracker (IN PROGRESS)**  
  Flask web app that extracts structured data from resumes and tracks applications by status.

- **Personal Portfolio Website**  
  Built with HTML, CSS, and JS, deployed with GitHub Pages to showcase my work and experience.
